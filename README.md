# Fashion MNIST using Pytorch

### The project is aimed at exploring Pytorch along with working on a image classification problem using the Fashion MNIST dataset. In the notebook, the following steps have been performed:
### 1. Load the dataset
### 2. Train a baseline model
### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
### 4. Train a refined model
### 5. Evaluate on a test set
